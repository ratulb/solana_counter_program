# Installation Notes
if you are a first-time user of Rust, the notes below may help you to install
some of the dependencies on a Mac or Linux workstation.

### Rust
You can install Rust using the 'rustup' tool. Rustup will install
the latest version of Rust, Cargo, and the other binaries used in Solana.

> **Note**: If this the first time that rust is being installed on linux - you might need to install build-essential. To install build-essential, run - `sudo apt install build-essential -y`

Follow the instructions at [Installing
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

For Mac users, Homebrew is also an option.  The Mac Homebrew command is `brew
install rustup` and then `rustup-init`. See [Mac
Setup](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Rust/) & [Installing
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more details.

After installation, you should have `rustc`, `cargo`, & `rustup`. You should
also have `~/.cargo/bin` in your PATH environment variable.

### Git Repository
Clone the 'solana_counter_program' repository into your development machine:
```bash
$ cd /path/to/your/work/folder/
$ git clone https://github.com/ratulb/solana_counter_program.git
$ cd solana_counter_program
```
(If you plan to submit changes in a pull request, be sure to create a fork first
and then clone your fork.)
